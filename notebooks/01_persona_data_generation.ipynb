      "1. **Carrier Transit Delays** – Once the package is handed over to the shipping carrier (such as UPS, FedEx, DHL, or a local postal service), they handle the logistics of getting it to you. Occasionally, they experience high volumes (especially around holidays or sales events), weather disruptions, or routing issues that can add extra days to the transit time.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Customs and International Processing** – If your order is traveling across borders, customs clearance can sometimes take longer than usual. This is out of our direct control, but we do try to provide all the necessary documentation to keep the process as swift as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Address Verification Issues** – Occasionally, if there’s a small discrepancy or missing information in the shipping address, the carrier may need to pause delivery to verify details. This can add a day or two, and sometimes it can cause a longer hold while they attempt contact.\n",
      "\n",
